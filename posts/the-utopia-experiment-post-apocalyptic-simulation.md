Have you ever felt like running away to the woods to life a simple life away from the stresses of society and technology? No emails, no workplace politics and no phone notifications. Many people have fantasies of leaving the establishment to live this life of simplicity and that's exactly what Dylan Evans, author of The Utopia Project did.

In 2007 he abandoned his job as a lecturer in robotics (burning many academic bridges along the way), sold his home and most of his possessions and started a ‘post apocalyptic simulation’ in the Scottish highlands.

The Utopia Project is a first hand account by Evans of his near-future world simulation in which the global economic structure had collapsed, which has led to mass starvation causing a 70% reduction in the world's population. Bustling cities would be no more: humans would form small bands which would be self sufficient and form settlements in the country.

Evans starts out with a clear vision of what Utopia would be:
1. A learning community: members must have a transferrable skill
2. A working community: members must contribute by working
3. Strictly time limited: members would stay between 3 weeks and 3 months.

At first the project succeeds but as he is split between his civilised and nomadic lifestyle, Evans and the other camp members lose focus and cracks start to appear in the simulation. The project fundamentally fails in some key areas, which are that the inhabitants didn’t possess the hunting or farming skills to sustain a healthy diet. The vision was of a self sufficient community where crafts and ideas would flourish, but in the end they had to make weekly shops in the local Tesco demonstrating how reliant he experiment was on the society they had rejected.

If you are part survivalist, part anthropologist and willing to be part therapist I’d highly recommend you read The Utopia Experiment, preferably while camped out in the woods. Dylan Evans has a very relaxed writing style and tells the story of his project with the humour that only his hindsight can afford him.
