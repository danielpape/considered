What does it mean to have an crammed contact list? Is it possible to have too many friends? Robin Dunbar is an evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford University who studied the human brain to answer these questions.

When studying the brain size and average group size for all primates, Dunbar found that there was a linear relationship between the size of an animals brain and the size of their tribe. Put simply: the larger your brain, the larger the number of members of your social group. When Dunbar applied Humans to the brain size/social group graph it put us at a tribe size of about 150 which became known as Dunbar's Number. We may be able to list our friends, but how do we know that Dunbar's number is true of humans apart from researching other primates?

We are now able to track your social interactions to a greater degree of accuracy due to online social networks. Facebook keeps a log of the friends that we have, as well as every time we communicate with them over their network.  Dunbar studied data directly from Facebook and made some interesting observations that tied into his original theory.

Many Facebook users have hundred of friends and it can often be a status symbol for someone to claim to have over 1000. At time of writing I have over 300 Facebook friends, but that's moderate for someone in their late 20s who's accrued friends from their hometown, university and colleagues. If we only have the mental capacity to maintain 150 relationships, how can we have multiple hundreds of Facebook friends? It turns out that we actually don't. When looking at the data it doesn't matter how many friends you have, on average you will only interact with around 120-150 of them. On top of that, you will only form strong relationships with 3-5 people. Those are the people who you turn to when you need help or the first people who sharing you successes with.

Relationships require time to be invested, even if it's just the time to send a quick message, but the strongest relationships require a much higher amount of your time to maintain. Dunbar discovered that you spend around 50% of your time talking to your 5 closest friends, and there's a high drop off from there.

Would you rather have 1000 friends who get 0.1% of your attention or 5 close friends who you can spend quality time with?
